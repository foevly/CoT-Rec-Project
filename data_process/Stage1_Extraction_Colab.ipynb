    "        f\"1. Provide an objective description of each item in the user's interaction history, focusing on factual features such as ingredients, health benefits, or notable qualities of each item.\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"2. Based on these descriptions, predict the user's overall preferences and describe their likely personality and tastes in detail in no more than 80 words.\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"   - The summarized user preferences should be based on the frequency and regularity of user behavior rather than occasional occurrences.\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"   - Avoid using generic or vague terms; be specific and relevant.\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"3. Use the predicted preferences to evaluate each candidate item. Each evaluation must include:\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"   - Objective features of the item (factual description).\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"   - User-specific comments based on their preferences, preceded by the tag `[Comment:]` to distinguish them from the factual description.\\n\"\n",

    "        f\"   - `user_history_perception`: Objective descriptions for items in the user's interaction history.\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"   - `user_preferences`: A summary of the user's preferences.\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"   - `candidate_temp_perception`: Evaluations for items in the candidate set, including both factual descriptions and user-specific comments (prefixed with `[Comment:]`).\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"   - `candidate_perception`: Summarized user-relevant aspects from `candidate_temp_perception` comments, highlighting the most significant point of interest or concern for each item.\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"5. Ensure the JSON format is strictly correct and complete.\\n\"\n",
    "        f\"   - Every item in the interaction history and candidate set must be included.\\n\"\n",
